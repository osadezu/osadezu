### Hola! 🙋‍♂️

#### I am a software engineer 🌞 and lighting designer 🌛 in NYC.

- 🔭 I'm exploring embedded system design and low-level MCU programming.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Swift for iOS, Rust, and how to wrestle with Home Assistant.
- 🙌 I'm looking to collaborate on smart lighting and other home automation projects.
- 💡 Ask me about lighting technologies and lighting control systems.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I took an 11-year detour designing lighting for architectural spaces, before returning to my engineering calling.
